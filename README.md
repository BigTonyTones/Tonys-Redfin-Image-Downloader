# Tonys Redfin Image Downloader v1.2

I made this tool to quickly grab high-res photos from Redfin listings. It has a nice dark theme, it's fast, and it automatically organizes everything into folders by address so you don't have to.

### What it does:
- **Grabs High-Res Photos**: Pulls the best quality images directly from Redfin.
- **Built-in Gallery**: You can browse your downloads right inside the app.
- **Adjustable View**: Use the slider to make thumbnails bigger or smaller.
- **Safe Setup**: It'll ask you before installing any missing Python packages.
- **Folders**: Every property gets its own folder named after the address.

### How to use it:
1.  **Open**: Just run `Start.bat`.
2.  **Paste**: Put a Redfin link in the box and hit Download.
3.  **Browse**: Click a property in your library on the left to see the photos.

### Requirements:
Requires Python 3. The app will help you install the other stuff (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `Pillow`) if you don't have them yet.
